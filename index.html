	***************** HELLO! *******************

	You must be serious if you're viewing the source.
	So let me first say hi and then say a few things about the site.

	You're probably wondering, why put all that jquery stuff on the site, like the animated letters and the motion background, well I kind of felt like I had to.  If it were up to me, I'd just put some links to the sites I've worked on.  But this site is for you, and it seems like every portfolio site has some gitchy js on it, just to say... "Hey look, I can make stuff move with Javascript!" So I guess felt compelled to do the same thing.

	Most of the js on this site is linked but if you want to see it use the link to my github account. You can see it there, as well as the code to the other sites I've built. Not all of the site are in public repositories, I had to make some of them private because of passwords and keys for payment systems and the like. You can look at those too, if you want, just let me know.

	Finally, let me say about myself, I'm probably the most well rounded developer you're looking at.  

	I don't mean that in a, "I know the most languages" way. I mean it in the breadth of my experience, I've been in sales, I've run my own company (and still do), I've been a teacher, I've been a carpenter, I've been a reporter, I've been a disk jockey, I've been an actor (and still am). My point is, I know how to survive in many different situations, I understand how businesses work, and I know that the key to success lies in the attitude you have when you approach problems. So, I'm a person that writes code that also understands the big picture and how the code fits into that.  And that's an intangible you probably won't find with others.

	*************** GOODBYE! *********************
